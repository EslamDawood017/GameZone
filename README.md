GameZone - Gaming Platform
Overview
GameZone is a gaming platform built using ASP.NET Core and the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The platform allows users to explore and interact with a collection of games, while admins can manage games, user profiles, and gaming statistics. The project demonstrates my skills in full-stack development, database management, and user interface design.
